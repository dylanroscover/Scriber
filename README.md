Typography layout, style and animation toolkit in TouchDesigner

## Why
TouchDesigner as a platform has plenty of character, however it lacks out-of-the-box *per*-character text transformations, such as kerning and animation. The aim of this component is to provide TD devs a toolkit to rapidly iterate professional, interactive text layouts and animations in TD.

    * Basic kerning
    * Basic animation (in/out)
- 🚧 In Development/Planned
    * Multi-line text
    * Per-word transformations
    * Colour
- 💾 Software
    * TouchDesigner 2020.26630

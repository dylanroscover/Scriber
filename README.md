Typography layout and animation toolkit in TouchDesigner

## Why
TouchDesigner as a platform has plenty of character, however it lacks out-of-the-box *per*-character text transformations, such as kerning and animation. The aim of this project is to provide TD devs a toolkit to rapidly iterate professional, interactive text layouts and animations in TD.

## Status
In Development.. Stay tuned for updates.

## Planned Features
- Per-character/word adjustments
    * colour
    * size
    * weight
    * kerning

- In/Out Animation
    * utilizes David Braun's Phaser CHOP

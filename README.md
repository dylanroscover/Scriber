Typography layout, style and animation toolkit in TouchDesigner

## 📝 Why
TouchDesigner as a platform has plenty of character, however it lacks out-of-the-box *per*-character text transformations, such as kerning and animation. The aim of this component is to provide TD devs a toolkit to rapidly iterate professional, interactive text layouts and animations in TD.

## 📝 Status
- 🚧 In Development
    * Basic kerning implemented
    * Currently working on init of animation
- 💾 TouchDesigner 2020.26630 Win 64 

## 📝 Planned Features
- Per-character/word transformations
    * colour
    * size
    * weight
    * kerning
    * animations
        * utilizing Phaser CHOP
        * translate (xyz)
        * rotate (xyz)
        * scale (xy)
        * pivot (xyz)

Typography layout, style and animation toolkit in TouchDesigner

## Why
TouchDesigner as a platform has plenty of character, however it lacks out-of-the-box *per*-character text transformations, such as kerning and animation. The aim of this component is to provide TD devs a toolkit to rapidly iterate type for motion graphics animations in TD.
